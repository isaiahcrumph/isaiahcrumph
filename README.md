### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello! I'm Isaiah C. Rumph, a full stack web developer with experience in React, SQL, and C#. 
I enjoy building software that is not only functional but also meaningful and maintainable. 
Currently offering freelancing services, I'm always eager to learn new technologies and collaborate on projects that make a positive impact.
Tech Stack

    Front-End: React (JavaScript/TypeScript), HTML5, CSS3

    Back-End: C# (.NET Core), SQL (Relational Databases)

    Tools: Git & GitHub, Visual Studio, VS Code

My Why

My work is driven by a personal mission:

    To cultivate agency, skillfulness, and truth, through art, effort, and connection, in non-dual existence as a systems engineer. 

This philosophy reminds me to keep learning, stay creative, and build with integrity through every project.
